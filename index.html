<center><p>Alan Mathison Turing was born in London at 1912. His birthplace now a museum. His father came from a colony in India. His education started when he was 6. His high intelligence was noticed at this age.Although Alan Turing was very young he was interested in math especially derivationand integral problems. When he was 14 years old he begins to Sherborne School in Dorset. Probably The Sherborne School would be one of the important thing in his life because he met with his first love named Christopher Marcom in there. But it was an unexpected situation because this relationship was between two man. Turing was so happy when he hanged out with him until learnt that he passed away because of tuberculosis a few weeks before the end of the school. The death of Christopher caused him to focus on his studies.

<center><p>After Sherborne, Turing registered at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, England, studying there from 1931 to 1934. In 1936, Turing delivered a paper,  named "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," After two years, Alan studied maths and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1938, he returned to Cambridge, and then took a position in a British code-breaking organization. </p></center>

<center><p> In September 1939 , Great Britain declared war against to Germany. Turing was called to the military to working trying to solve the encrypted messages in German communication code send by radio in Morse code. Germans used a machnine called ‘Enigma’ . This machine has a different working format. Who ever wanted to break the code, had to konw the initial configuration of Enigma. So Turing have a new idea: “What if what it takes to compete with Enigma we would use another machine against it?” So following this idea, Turing created Bombe, another machine who tried to solve Enigma´s configuration. in 1940, the Britain Service began to produce the machines in series, then they found another problem: Enigma had different version of configurations for the different fronts they were fighting at and some of the versions were a lot more hard to solver. </p></center>

<center><p>After a while, Turing came with a new idea have an easier decoding. In 1941, a German submarine which was about to sink in battle, provided an Enigma machine to the allies and the codes for three months. Hitler wasn’t able to submit Great Britain with the constant bombarding over the country so he proposed to starve the English people to death by destroying the incoming sea convoys with humanitarian help from the United States with the lethal German submarines. So it was calculated that because of the new method and the lucky strike of the sink German submarine, about a 30% of the convoys with supplies for the Allies reached their destiny.</p></center>
